*Describe the Kaggle Competition and Its Connection to the Break Through Tech AI Program:* This Kaggle competition encourages students to explore how different machine learning models can be used to classify skin conditions across diverse skin tones to ensure underrepresented and marginalized groups are equitably represented in the machine learning space. This Kaggle competition connects to the Break Through AI Program since both their missions are centered on increasing inclusivity and fairness in the fields of AI/ML. 

*Describe Dataset:* The dataset is a subset of the FitzPatrick17k dataset, which is a collection of around 4,500 labeled images of 21 dermatological conditions out of the 100+ in the full FitzPatrick set. The images are scored on the FitzPatrick skin tone scale and they were sourced from reputable dermatology websites. 

*Describe Data Exploration:* In order to explore the data we were given, our group first examined the different kinds of data we were given and the balance within the overall dataset. We also focused on examining relationships between the different variables and data we were given to see how we could leverage those relationships to best identify statistically significant results with our final model.
